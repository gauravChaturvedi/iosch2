Build An iOS app in swift 
that:

- Pulls data of all [launches](https://docs.spacexdata.com/?version=latest#5fc4c846-c373-43df-a10a-e9faf80a8b0a) - filter out all launches before 2014

- The list of launches should show in a list as per the attached design, so instead of dominos or starbucks, it'll be the name of the capsule and instead of the price it'll be the date of launch

- In the element that says "Current Balance" replace it with "Total Launches" and display the total number of launches instead of "$234,ooo"

- Instead of "Good Evening, Philip", put in your name

- No menu bar is required

- Leverage [this api](https://docs.spacexdata.com/?version=latest#cfcc49e7-5fe4-4dd3-9701-7c5caf7af9fb) to build out the following feature: If I tap on a launch from the list of launches, I should be able to see a simple popup (no major styling required) with the following details: `flight_number, mission_name, mission_id`


###### Other Instructions 
While you're not expected to build an app that resembles a high-fidelity design, please make sure the app is functional and also has appropriate UI elements in place. Don't worry about colors etc too much as it is code quality and various choices you make in the process that matter most. 

Please work independently, make regular commits, spill coffee on your keyboards and be honest in your efforts.

Code this out as you would for a startup that you're investing in, yourself :)
